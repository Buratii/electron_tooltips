## ðŸ§ª Mocks

### Users List Mock (`users.mock.ts`)

```ts
export const mockedData = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Alice",
    email: "alice@example.com",
    birthday: "2025-08-01T21:26:06.102Z",

```ts
import type { Guide } from "../types/guide.interface";

export const guides: Guide[] = [
  {
    page: "list",
    tooltips: [
      { id: "input-search",  title: "User Search",       content: "Use this search bar to quickly find users by typing their name or email. Start typing to see filtered results instantly.", action: "next" },
      { id: "button-add",    title: "Add a New User",    content: "Click this button to navigate to the user registration form and add a new user to the list.", action: "next" },
      { id: "users-table",   title: "Users Table Header", content: "This is the header of the users table. Below, you'll find detailed information for each user in the list.", action: "next" },
      { id: "column-name",   title: "Name Column",       content: "This column displays the full name of each user. Click on a name to view more details (feature coming soon).", action: "next" },
      { id: "column-email",  title: "Email Column",      content: "This column shows the email address associated with each user. Ensure emails are unique and valid.", action: "next" },
      { id: "column-birthday", title: "Birthday Column", content: "This column displays the user's date of birth in DD/MM/YYYY format.", action: "finish" },
    ],

    page: "form",
    tooltips: [
      { id: "input-name",     title: "Full Name Field",     content: "Enter the complete name of the user here. This field is mandatory for creating a user profile.", action: "next" },

## ðŸ§­ How the Tooltip Guide Works

* The guide is **pageâ€‘aware** via the `page` field (e.g., `"list"`, `"form"`). Use your router location to pick the correct guide.
* Each tooltip targets a DOM element by **ID** (e.g., `id="input-search"`). Ensure your components render these IDs.
* `action` controls flow:

  * `"next"` â†’ proceed to the next tooltip in the current page sequence
  * `"finish"` â†’ closes the guide
* A small state machine/hook (e.g., `useGuide`) can:

  * Expose `currentStep`, `next()`, `finish()`
  * Handle visibility and focus/scrollâ€‘intoâ€‘view of target elements
  * Optionally persist progress (localStorage) so the tour doesnâ€™t restart every time
